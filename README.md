# Portal

Portal for HanGee Plan

## General

This static website is generated by [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/) (just because I hate raw html), which do the stuff like compiling, coping and publishing.
The structure is like:

1. Jade(template) + SASS(css extension)  *this part is where you'll do the modification

2. (compile by grunt)

3. raw html & css files in local branch (put in a new directory named

```
/build
```
automatically)

4. (pusblish by grunt)

5. what we see static files in gh-pages

If there are any problems and bugs about the structure, you can also push your commit to develop branch, or create a new feature branch when needed.

## Tools you need

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install)
